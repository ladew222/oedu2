We will explore these themes both in a general way as well as through the lens of particular disciplines. For example: biology and the evolution/intelligent design debate, cognitive psychology and the nature of consciousness debate, physics (quantum mechanics) and the nature of reality debate, and astronomy/cosmology on the big bang and the question of 'fine-tuning.'
